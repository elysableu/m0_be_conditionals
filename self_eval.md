# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
<br>
*It's useful to use a `conditional` when you need to have different outcomes based on the current state of the code or the test if certain conditions are met before moving on in the code.*

2. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
<br>
*When I started this assignment, I had a little confusion with the Ruby syntax, which caused several errors to be throw.  Next time I will review the lesson on variables and conditionals to ensure that I am familiar with the syntax.*

3. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
<br>
*I felt the most satisfaction when I tackled the code_challenges.  I started with the comparsions and if_statements practice, and I had a few hiccups while I figured out Ruby's syntax.  When I got to the challenges I felt more confident and was able to fly through them with little to no errors.*
